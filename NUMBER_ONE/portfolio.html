        As i pursue my diploma, am also a chat bots constructor, and i would also love to add on that I am curretly majoring in python as a programming language.<br>
        I also offer gtaphics designs, as a course unit, i simply love it because it gives me space to convey the thoughts i cant get out of my mind.
        I would say i amy be more of a backend developer, because i really do get a lot of these random ideas i want to see manifest.
